# Reading Level Correlation Chart

A chart of the __approximate__ relationship between different reading level assessment systems.

## Why

Parents and guardians are often told their student “is reading at…” or “has been assessed at…” a certain reading level. They are encouraged to help the student find books at their level to read at home. Then they dutifully go to the library or bookstore only to discover that there are several different reading level systems and that publishers usually only reference one system, if any. Librarians and library volunteers do their best to help, but may only be familiar with one or two systems.

This chart is an _attempt_ to help families find books for their student across reading level assessment systems. The chart aggregates information published by various organizations such as publishers, school districts, libraries, and departments of education.
